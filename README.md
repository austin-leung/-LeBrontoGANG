# GyulHap

Find the sets by matching trios of boxes where each property is either all the same of all different. For clarification on the rules, read more here: https://puzzles.setgame.com/set/rules_set.htm .

Bugs:

* The timer and score flash repeatedly
* Sometimes clicking on boxes is unresponsive (possibly because of lag due to complexity of code)
* Doesn't show third box as selected
* The area for clicking on a box is just a centered circle and not in the entire shape of the box


To try it out, run HAP/hap.pde with processing.
